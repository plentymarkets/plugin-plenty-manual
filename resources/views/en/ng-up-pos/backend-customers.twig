<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have you booked the plentymarkets point of sale module and bought the necessary hardware? Then you’re ready to start setting it all up!
So head over to your computer and open your plentymarkets system. There are several initial settings that you’ll need to configure before you begin ringing up customers with your tablet or smartphone. This video should help you understand what you’ll need to configure and why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, open the "System" menu and navigate to "POS".
Just click on the plus icon to add a new point of sale system.
At first glance, it looks like there are a lot of settings to configure in this menu. But essentially, you just need to tell plentymarkets a bit about your store and how it operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, geography. Where’s your store located?
In plentymarkets, enter the name and address of the brick and mortar store, where this point of sale system will be operated.
Do you want this contact information to be displayed on receipts too? You can do that in this tab.
If you’ve already entered master data about your company, then this information will automatically show up here.
But you can change this text as needed or add additional information like your store’s hours or its return policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What about the items on your store shelves? Tell plentymarkets a little about the products that you sell.
In other words, use these two filters here to specify which items you sell in your brick and mortar store.
If you check this box, then your point of sale system will only be able to find those items that were made available for POS like so.
And if you check this box, then your point of sale system will only be able to find those items that were activated.
Next, use the warehouse options here, to tell plentymarkets where the items in your store come from and where you’ll send them if they need repairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You know your product line like the back of your hand, and you know which items sell most often.
Now you can ring up customers even faster by grouping these best sellers together in the point of sale system.
In plentymarkets, simply pick whichever items sell most frequently and should be displayed together.
Back in the basic settings, decide whether favourite items should initially start out with a quantity of 1 or whether you’d prefer that cashiers enter the quantity themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your store is starting to come together. There are products on your shelves, and you’re ready to start thinking about how customers will pay for their items.
First stop, sales prices!
Either create a new sales price that you’ll use exclusively for your point of sale system or open one of your existing prices.
Either way, make sure that you’ve activated your point of sale system as the referrer.
If you don’t see your POS system listed here, just open up the "Order referrer" menu and activate it with a check mark. Once you’ve finished configuring sales prices, find all of the items that you’ll sell in your store and save prices for them like so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing on with payment, next you’ll decide how customers pay for items in your brick and mortar store.
When you’re first getting started, you’ll probably want to allow customers to pay with cash.
So just activate this payment method, make sure it’s linked to the correct client and make sure you haven’t accidentally saved any surcharges.
As your business grows, you may want to add other payment methods like debit card terminals that communicate directly with your point of sale system. If you do, then you’ll need to configure a few extra settings, which are explained in our additional reference materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, spend some time thinking about who exactly will be ringing up customers in your brick and mortar store.
In other words, create or modify user accounts and grant all your cashiers access to the POS system.
Admin users can access the app by default.
But variable users need to be granted the rights to do so.
We recommend that you create a role for your cashiers and then customise its rights, as specified in our online manual.
When you’re done, just assign your cashiers to this role and they’ll automatically be granted all of its rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When your doors open, customers start streaming in. And when you’re selling items in a brick and mortar store, the customer is usually someone you don’t know. In other words, you’re often just selling to an anonymous, default customer.
In your plentymarkets system, create a dummy data record that will stand in for all of the anonymous customers who buy something in your store.
When you’ve finished creating the default customer data record, head back over to your point of sale system and select it here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you’ll tell plentymarkets how your items get to customers. Now, in the world of e-commerce, items are delivered. But in brick and mortar stores, customers simply take items home with them.
In plentymarkets, that means you’ll need to create a new shipping service provider and call it something like "self pickup".
Then create a corresponding shipping profile as well.
Simply follow along with the instructions in our online manual to see which exact settings and options you should configure when creating a new shipping profile.
Don’t forget to configure the table of shipping charges when you’re done.
Of course, you won’t want to accidentally charge a shipping fee for walk-in customers. So make sure that 0 is entered here and then save the settings.
When you’re done, don’t forget to link this shipping profile to all the items you sell in your brick and mortar store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’re nearing the finish line! Your point of sale system is ready to start ringing up customers! But what about stock and inventory? It’s a big time drain to manually keep track of how many items were sold and how many you’ve got left in stock. Instead, let plentymarkets do it automatically! Simply create an event procedure, which automatically books the item as outgoing every time you make a sale.
Just create an event procedure, which goes into effect as soon as the receipt was generated.
Use filters to make sure the event procedure only applies to your point of sale system and that it only applies to regular orders.
Then add a procedure to book items as outgoing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what if a customer changes their mind or you need to cancel a transaction?
Simply use this option here to tell plentymarkets what it should do.
If you check this option, then plentymarkets will mentally put the item back on the shelf. Or in other words, it will un-do the fact that it lowered your stock level while ringing up the customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this video, you learned how to configure the settings for your POS system. Essentially, you told plentymarkets a bit about your store and how it operates. For example, where your store is located, who uses the cash register and which items you sell.
You also told plentymarkets how transactions are made in your store. For example, which payment methods you accept, which shipping profile you use for walk-in customers and whether or not plentymarkets should automatically adjust your stock levels when you make a sale.
There was a lot of information in this video, but don’t sweat it if there’s something you didn’t understand. Our online manual provides step-by-step instructions for every aspect of the configuration.
We’ve also put together a checklist, which summarises the settings discussed in this video.

<p>Welcome to plentymarkets e-learning. In this video, I’ll give you a quick introduction to creating items in plentymarkets 7. The main difference in plentymarkets 7 is that we no longer solely create an item as was the case in earlier plentymarkets versions, but we now also create variations when we set up a new item. So in this video tutorial, I’ll show you how to create an item along with a main variation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alright, so let’s get started. As you can see, I’ve opened my system to Item &gt; Edit item.
First, I click 'New' up here which opens up a new tab where I can enter various item information.
Let’s take a look at the options under Item data. It is possible to enter the Item ID here, but I would leave this field blank. That way my system simply creates a consecutive item ID on its own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Manufacturer dropdown menu here allows me to select the manufacturer of the item. Of course, these have to be created in my system beforehand.
Under 'Name', I enter what I want the item to be called.
The next two dropdown menus allow me to select up to two flags for this item.
In the last field here, I can define the item type, so either Stocked item, Production item, Colli or Special order item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fields under 'Variation - Basic settings' allow me to enter important settings for my main variation. Again, I enter the name of the variation in the first field. And similarly to the Item ID, the variation number is assigned automatically based on the pattern saved in the Settings » Items » Basic settings menu. However, I can still change the variation number later on if I need to.
I can also enter an external variation ID for the main variation of the item, but this information is optional. It facilitates importing items and variations from external systems to plentymarkets.
In this field here, I obviously enter the model number or name. And under content, which is a required field, I enter the quantity of a certain unit. For my example, my item is one piece.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over here under Variation &gt; Attributes, I can specify various attributes. The attributes that I select here are assigned to my main variation. And any additional variations that I create for the item will only be able to have the attributes selected here as well. If I don’t want to select attributes just yet, then I can also initially create the main variation without any attributes, and then select the attributes when I create additional variations later on. In this example, I won’t select any attributes just yet.
All the way on the right over here, I can enter my sales prices in the corresponding fields. I can also delete any sales prices I don’t need by clicking on the delete icon. If I want to add those prices again in the future, I simply select the sales price from the drop-down menu and click on the green plus icon.
The area down here allows me to link the variation to the category I want it to be assigned to in my online store.
Once I’ve entered all of the information, I click save and the item is created. Of course, I can enter additional settings in all of the various tabs down here. We’ll be looking at these tabs in detail in additional videos.</p>

<p>Does your supplier send you lots of files with product information?
For example, maybe you sell seasonal items, so the products in your store change regularly.
Whatever the reason, if you frequently receive new CSV files from your supplier, then it would be a headache to manually switch out the old file, every time you receive a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This video shows you a more efficient way.
All you’ll need is an FTP server or a secure FTP server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you already learned in our basic instructional video, start out by entering your access data so that plentymarkets can reach the file.
Then tell plentymarkets what the file’s called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far so good. All that’s left to do now is make sure your supplier agrees to always save the new CSV file on this FTP server and with a file name that starts out the same way.
But instead of this last part of the file name, just use an asterisk and tell plentymarkets to automatically archive the file once it’s been imported.
Taken all together, whenever your supplier saves a new file, plentymarkets will automatically import the data at the agreed upon time and then move the file to the archive, so that the FTP server is ready to be used again for the next file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s just that easy! No need to manually switch out old files.
ElasticSync automates the job so that you always stay up to date.</p>

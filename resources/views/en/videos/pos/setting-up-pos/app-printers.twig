<p>"Hello…​ Google. How do I get apps from the…​ internets?"<br>
Follow along with Dorothy’s example and download the free plentymarkets app onto your tablet or smartphone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is check the date and time on your device’s settings.
Essentially, you’ll need to make sure your tablet automatically adjusts the clock for daylight savings time. It’s important for your tablet to know what time it is - or in other words, for your tablet to know the exact times when items were purchased. Otherwise your tablet will make mistakes when deciding which orders were placed during which shift and which orders should be included on which x and z reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve got the time all squared away, you’re ready to log into the app for the first time.
All you needs to do is enter the URL for your plentymarkets system and then enter the user name and password that you normally use when logging into plentymarkets.
You’ll remain logged in until you actively log back out. So in other words, you’ll be able to close and re-open the app without having to log in again each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this home screen, just tap on the main menu in the upper left corner to access loads of plentymarkets functions on the go.
For example, you can take a look at the orders your business has received, you can pick and pack items while in the warehouse or of course, you can ring up customers in your brick and mortar store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But before you’ll be able to open this menu, you’ll need to head over to the app settings and link your point of sale system to your tablet or smartphone.
In other words, you’ll need to select the client and POS system that you previously configured in plentymarkets.
Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with these settings yet. Just take a look at our video that walks you through the configuration process.
Next, decide whether you want the app to calculate gross or net prices while you ring up customers and enter the IP address for your receipt printer.
Then scroll down and decide whether you’d like documents to be printed automatically when the payment process is complete or whether you’d prefer to manually trigger when documents are printed.
You may also want to print a test page and make sure that everything was set up correctly.
Last but not least, decide whether you’d prefer the screen to look like a tablet or a smartphone while you ring up customers. Or in other words, whether the screen should have a vertical or horizontal layout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’re happy with the settings, link this device to your point of sale system.
It’s now possible to begin ringing up customers in your brick and mortar store.
In plentymarkets, you can tell which POS systems were already linked to a device, because you’ll see that device’s UUID displayed here. Just keep in mind that it’s only possible to link one device to each POS system. So, for example, if you want to ring up customers on 2 different tablets, then you’ll need to create 2 POS systems in plentymarkets as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before saying goodbye, let’s take another quick look at the settings for your POS system.
You probably noticed that I skipped over all of these additional printer options here. These settings are only relevant if you want to print receipts and documents on other printers. For example, if you’re going to archive certain documents, then you may want to print them on A4 size paper.
If this is something you’d like to do, then simply download and configure plentyBase on your computer and navigate to the settings for plentyBase in the app.
Here you’ll need to enter the IP address of whatever computer plentyBase is running on, the HTTP port, which you can find in the plentyBase configuration menu and the access token, which you can find in your plentymarkets backend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you’ve finished setting up the app, you can give it your very own custom look and feel.
For starters, you can save key figures about your business and group them together thematically.
Just add all the different statistics that you’d like to see on the home screen.
And when you’re done, you can personalise the app even further by choosing which background image you’d like to see on the home screen.
Now that Dorothy’s downloaded the plentymarkets app and linked it to her hardware, she’s ready to start ringing up customers in her brick and mortar store.</p>

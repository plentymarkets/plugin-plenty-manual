<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’re probably familiar with Amazon Prime - the loyalty program that promises its members super-fast delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And you probably also know that loads of customers look for the prime badge when deciding just whose product to buy. But do you know how you can become a prime seller yourself?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Amazon ships packages on your behalf - or in other words, if your items are stored in Amazon’s warehouse and shipped with FBA - then congratulations, you’re already a prime seller!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, if you store and ship items from your own warehouse, then you’re not automatically a prime seller.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can still become one though. You just need to apply for Seller Fulfilled Prime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to qualify, you’ll need to meet a few specific requirements. For example, the ability to ship at least 99% of your orders on time, and an order cancellation rate under 1%.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll also need to complete a trial period, which proves that your business meets these requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve been approved, you’ll need to configure a few Amazon Prime settings one time only in your plentymarkets system. Then you’ll be able to start creating Amazon Prime shipping labels. In this video, I’ll show you how to create labels manually in the plentymarkets shipping center, or automatically with a process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alright, let’s get started. The first thing you’ll need to do is create a shipping profile for Amazon Prime. So you’ll want to open the shipping settings and click on the "Shipping profiles" tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you’ll need to create a new shipping profile for one of the carriers approved by Seller Fulfilled Prime. For example, Royal Mail if your business is in the UK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can start out by configuring the settings just like you would with any other shipping profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only setting that I want to mention specifically is this one here called "Loyalty program".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just select the appropriate loyalty program, like "Amazon Prime".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then, once you’ve finished configuring the settings, click on the save icon and open the table of shipping charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Amazon Prime is a free shipping service, make sure you don’t enter any shipping charges here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather, just save the region as it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then reload the menu to see a few additional options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Down here, select the appropriate Amazon Prime service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So for example, Royal Mail Tracked 24 and then save the settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve finished saving the shipping profile, you’ll need to tell plentymarkets which items will be shipped with Prime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So just open whichever items you want to be included in Seller Fulfilled Prime, click on the global tab, and place a check mark to select the profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, don’t forget to save the settings when you’re finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just FYI, if you need to activate this profile for several different items, then you’ll probably find it quicker to use the group function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that plentymarkets knows which items will be shipped with Prime, you’ll also need to tell Amazon which items are Prime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is done by creating a so-called "property" in plentymarkets and linking it to the Amazon field called "merchant_shipping_group_name".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you’ll add this property to all of your Amazon Prime items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations! You’ve finished configuring the settings and you’re ready to start generating Amazon Prime shipping labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I mentioned at the start of this video, you can generate labels manually or automatically. I’ll show you both methods to help you understand the concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But keep in mind that Prime is all about speed - or how fast you can fulfil orders. So realistically, you won’t have enough time to manually generate labels for all of your orders. Instead, if you’re serious about Prime, you’ll also need to think about automation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let’s look at how to manually generate Prime labels within the plentymarkets shipping centre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, simply use filters to search for whichever orders you want to ship with Amazon Prime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then place check marks to specify which exact orders should be registered with Prime and Royal Mail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click on the "Register" tab, select Amazon Prime as the shipping provider, and decide which status the orders should have once they’ve been registered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then click on the gear-wheel icon to carry out the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you’re finished, click on the "Label" tab and then on this icon here to generate PDF shipping labels, which you can download, print and stick to your packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These three steps - find the order, register it with Royal Mail, and print the Prime label - can also be carried out automatically, with the help of a fulfilment process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, the steps are the same. But this time you use a process to find the order, register it with Royal Mail, and print the Prime label.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like you used filters to manually search for the orders that you wanted to ship with Prime, you can use a work step to automatically specify the exact same filter criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And just like you manually chose the shipping provider and status, you can automatically pick the new status here, and the shipping provider here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, instead of manually printing out the shipping label, you can automatically print it with a process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, this is just a bare bones example to help you understand the concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can integrate Prime into your regular fulfilment process and generate labels, just as you would for any other shipping service provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what are you waiting for? Apply for Seller Fulfilled Prime and start delivering Prime products from your very own warehouse.</p>

<div class="title">The new <strong>Ceres</strong> online store</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of now, online store projects are based on the new online store plugin  <a href="/en/omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-ceres">Ceres</a>. The <strong>Ceres</strong> store uses the latest and future-proof <a href="/en/basics/first-steps/plugins">plugin technology</a>. Ceres can be customised easily and extended by additional plugins from the <a href="https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plentyMarketplace</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online stores that have been created on the basis of the old CMS will be maintained during the transition period. However, no new features will be developed for the old CMS. We recommend to use the new <strong>Ceres</strong> online store for all future online store projects.</p>

<p>In this menu, you can configure important settings that relate to the order process in your online store. For example, you can decide which elements should be displayed to store visitors. Additionally, you can decide whether entering specific information should be compulsory or not. As such, e.g. the item condition can be displayed or hidden, even when it has been entered. You can select whether registration for the newsletter should generally apply or should only apply to specific customers or should not be displayed at all, and much more.</p>

<p>The order process is a crucial part of any online transaction. As such, it is particularly important that you make sure all your settings in this area are correct and user-friendly. Otherwise, potential buyers might change their minds about ordering from your store at the last minute. Therefore, pay close attention to the information regarding the store order process options in <a href="#table-store-order-process-settings">Table 1</a> and seek advice if necessary.</p>

If you mark an item availability as &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt;, then your customers will be able to enter a delivery date for all items that have this availability. This information can be entered during the order process. You can also choose whether it should be mandatory for customers to specify a delivery date. The customer has to enter a delivery date before the item will added to the shopping cart if the entry is set as mandatory. If they do not enter a date for mandatory delivery dates an additional message will be displayed to remind them to enter a date. Otherwise the item will not be placed in the shopping cart.&lt;br /&gt;
If only the option &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; was selected and the customer did not enter a delivery date when adding the item to the shopping cart, then they can still do so in the shopping cart by clicking on the &lt;strong&gt;Change delivery date&lt;/strong&gt; link and entering a date. However, doing so is not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CMS&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for the delivery date to be displayed in the order process, you need to insert the code &lt;strong&gt;&lt; input name="DeliveryDate" type="text" / &gt; &lt;/strong&gt; into the template &lt;strong&gt;ItemViewSingleItem&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;FormOpen_Order&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;FormClose_Order&lt;/strong&gt;.

<p>The <strong>Client (store)</strong> menu allows you to manage and link several online stores to one back office/administrative system. This means that you can set up several further stores beside your standard online store. Up to 30 independent online stores (clients) can be managed with one plentymarkets system. These online stores are closed and independent systems. Their data is separated from the data of other stores. Consequently, it is possible to handle several different areas of business with one plentymarkets system. You will find an example with the possibilities of linking several online stores in chapter 4 of this page of the manual.</p>

<div class="title">Tip: The plentymarkets online store</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>plentymarkets contains a fully integrated online store function (B2B &amp; B2C). Each store is accessible via an individual domain. With the help of the integrated CMS (content management system), it is possible to carry out changes and extensions with regard to content and graphics. Individual store templates can be directly imported in a complete online store design format with pre-configured settings. This can be done in the <strong><a href="/en/omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/cms">CMS</a></strong> menu. It is also possible to hire an external agency or one of our certified service providers to create the online store design for you (fee-based service).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, it is useful to set up one or more additional stores if you want to offer very distinctive product portfolios on different domains. This way, you can manage orders and items in one central system. You can individually define the design and items that are to be displayed in each store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One central system is used for processing orders. This includes the printing of invoices as well as an email service. It is possible to use different <a href="/en/orders/order-documents#1800">number ranges</a> for each client (store) and each country of delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If two stores of one system are linked together with a banner, then the shopping cart will remain as it is when switching from one store to the other. For further information, refer to section 4 on this page of the manual.</p>

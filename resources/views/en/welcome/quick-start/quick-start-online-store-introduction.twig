<p>After creating your items and possibly setting up an interface to eBay in the previous chapters, we will now incorporate various payment methods in your online store as well as how to change its design. plentymarkets provides these functionalities, as well as others, via plugins.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no plugins installed on your system by default. Go to <strong>System » Assistants</strong> and complete the <strong>Integrations Assistant</strong> to install some basic extensions.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of this quick start guide, we will use plentyShop Ceres, the payment methods PayPal and cash in advance, as well as DHL as shipping provider. If you do not want to use some of them, skip the respective chapters of the quick start guide.</p>

<p>The table shows your plugin sets. Sets are collections of plugins that all impact the design and functionality of your store as a whole. By linking a set to a client, you activate it for the associated store. Later on you can also create new sets without linking them to a client.This allows you to test changes without them impacting your live environment. Throughout this quick start, we will only work with the standard-shop set provided by default, however. First, unlink the set from the client.</p>

<p>Unlinking a plugin set:</p>
</div><div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Go to <strong>Plugins » Plugin set overview</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Link clients and plugin sets</strong> button (<span class="icon yellow"><i class="psicon-link"></i></span>).<br>
→ The <strong>Manage clients</strong> window opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag and drop the client into the <strong>Unlinked clients</strong> area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save</strong> (<span class="icon green"><i class="fa fa-save  "></i></span>) the settings.</p>

</ol>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Open a plugin set (<span class="icon yellow"><i class="fa fa-pencil  "></i></span>) to view the plugins installed in the set.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Right next to the plugin sets, you will find filter settings. You can use these to display a different selection of plugins according to various criteria. When you open a plugin set, it shows all plugins installed in that set by default.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>We will have a closer look at the plentyShop plugins Ceres and IO later on. For now, we want to give customers the possibility to actually pay for their purchases.</p>

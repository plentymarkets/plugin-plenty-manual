<h2 id="20">2. Booking payments</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Payments can either come into your system automatically or they can be booked manually. For example, payments will automatically be imported into your system if you use interfaces to external payment providers. Some payment providers forward the customer to their own page for finalising the payment process. Others have your online shop receive the payment details and then forward them to the provider in the background. In both cases, plentymarkets receives a confirmation from the provider after a payment has been made successfully and makes a note of the incoming payment directly in the order. You can e.g. manually import bank postings for payments made without a payment provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="30">2.1. Importing bank postings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The payment method cash in advance and other transfers take the form of bank postings. With these payment methods, the payments that were booked on your account have to be reported to the system and then they need to be assigned to the orders. Import bank postings into your plentymarkets system in CSV format. Note that the order of the parameters depends on your bank program. First, carry out the necessary data format settings:</p>

<p>It is recommended that you take a look at the unassigned payments before editing orders.

This saves your customers long waiting times and it saves you unpleasant complaints.</p>

<p>At least once a week, you should edit and sort out the unassigned payments so that you don’t lose track of them in your day-to-day business.

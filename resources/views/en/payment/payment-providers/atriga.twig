<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>plentymarkets customers don’t have to make any advance debt collection payments and they don’t incur any costs in the case of failure. They receive 100% payment in the case of success. You can get information about any detail of your debt collection processes around the clock. This information can either be made available online with the DebitManager, email, and/or RSS feed. Your debtor’s SCHUFA credit check* is included free of charge in atriga’s <a href="http://gateway.atriga.com/dls/services/?DID=400002000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt collection process</a>&nbsp;<span class="icon "><i class="fa fa-external-link  "></i></span>. The report provides you with a solid assessment of how your debtor is doing financially.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph subhead">
<p>The atriga guarantee</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With atriga debt collection, no additional costs will be incurred afterwards – regardless of success or failure. If the total debt claim is paid, then you will receive 100% of your main and accessory claims including interest rates. That is why you can immediately make use of professional help, also for small invoice amounts, without risking any costs.<br>
With the help of the SCHUFA-declaration (credit insurance agency)<strong>, atriga will customise the debt collection process according to the economic situation of your debtor. This way atriga ensures that all measures that can balance your pending debt claims will be taken. If possible, these measures include e.g.: dunning letters that will be individually discussed with you and could also be sent via email, fax or text message, reporting the payment history of your debtor to the SCHUFA</strong>, skilled atriga employees and lawyers will contact the debtor by telephone, a personal visit to the debtor is possible and at last legal dunning procedures can be taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph subhead">
<p>Dunning procedure plus</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you should decide to take legal action in carrying out the dunning procedure then, with a good debtor credit rating, you will only incur costs for external advance payments (e.g. court fees, marshal’s fees), which you would have to pay in advance anyway until the debtor has paid these back.</p>

<p>Go to the atriga <a href="http://dm.atriga.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DebitManager™</a>&nbsp;<span class="icon "><i class="fa fa-external-link  "></i></span> to register online for free and without any obligation. <br>
At the end of the registration process, you will receive an atriga customer number. Email this customer number to <a href="mailto:info@atriga.com">info@atriga.com</a>&nbsp;<span class="icon "><i class="fa fa-external-link  "></i></span>. Put the word "plentymarkets" in the subject line of this email in order to receive the conditions mentioned above. atriga will then save you as a plentymarkets customer. After being saved, you will receive a message from atriga. You are now able to set up the automatic transfer of debt collection data. <br>
atriga transfers money to your account as soon as a debtor has paid. If possible, they transfer your money the same day. However, atriga can only transfer money to you if they have information about an authorised bank account. Provide atriga with this information before you have finished the activation process. This authorised account is saved under your bank details in your DebitManager™.</p>

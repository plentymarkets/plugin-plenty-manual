<p>Payments can either come into your system automatically or they can be booked manually. After payments are booked in plentymarkets, they are automatically assigned to orders with a fuzzy search. If the payment cannot be assigned to the order automatically, then you can still manually assign the payment to an order. Edit and manage payments in the <strong>Orders » Payments</strong> menu. Unassigned orders can be identified by the credit card symbol(<span class="icon "><i class="material-credit_card"></i></span>). You can <a href="/en/payment/beta-managing-payments#30">assign payments</a> either directly on the payments overview or in the detail view of a payment.<br>
In this overview, payments are displayed in your <a href="/en/payment/currencies#30">system currency</a>. If the payment is in a different currency, this amount is displayed in brackets next to the system currency.</p>

<div class="title">Important for detaching payments</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detaching a payment from an order is technically possible at all times, even when order processing has advanced or is completed. But detaching a payment should only be done cautiously and with good reason because errors, for example that a payment no longer covers an open order amount, are likely to occur when a payment is detached and assigned repeatedly. Further note that detaching a payment also causes changes to the order it was detached from, for example a recalculation of the payment of an order or a status change.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manually booked incoming payments, imported bank postings as well as EBICS payments can be split. This means that the amount of a payment can be split and assigned to several orders. This is done in the <strong>Orders » Payments</strong> menu. Note that Provisional postings cannot be split. To split payments, proceed as follows.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Save</strong> (<span class="icon "><i class="material-save"></i></span>).<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When splitting a payment, the amount of the payment is reduced by the corresponding amounts of the orders that were selected during the division of the payment. Both, the original total amount of the payment as well as the leftover open amount are displayed in this view. When a leftover open amount is created by splitting a payment, this amount could be split again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>An example</em>: Imagine you want to split a payment with the amount of 120 Euros into order A, which has an open amount of 80 Euros, and into order B, which has an open amount of 20 Euros. By splitting the payment and selecting these two orders, order A is assigned 80 Euros and order B 20 Euros. The payments created by splitting the original payment are automatically assigned to the selected orders. An amount of 20 Euros is left from the original payment. You can now assign this leftover amount to another order or, if required, can split it again.</p>

<p>Sometimes, not the whole selection can be edited. For example, if one or several of the selected payments are assigned to an order, they cannot be deleted.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the auto-assignment depends on the setting <strong>Match for automatic assignment (0.7 - 1.0)</strong> in the <strong>Setup » Orders » Payment » Incoming</strong> menu. The value 0.7 stands for a 70% match and the value 1.0 stands for a 100% match. If two orders are found with the same matching rate while auto-assigning payments, the payment cannot be assigned. This also means that a payment can only be auto-assigned when just one order with the corresponding matching rate was found.</p>

<h2 id="100">9. Displaying incoming payments on the dashboard</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add the element <strong>Payments</strong> to the <a href="/en/welcome/customise-system#110">dashboard</a> of your plentymarkets back end. This element displays information about unassigned payments as well as about all incoming payments from yesterday and today. If you don’t want to use this element on your dashboard, you can get the same results by going to <strong>Orders » payments</strong> and using the search filters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended that you take a look at the unassigned payments before editing orders. You should see whether incoming <strong>cash in advance</strong> payments are among them, which can usually be assigned to an order without a doubt thanks to the amount and the booking text. This saves your customers long waiting times and it saves you unpleasant complaints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At least once a week, you should edit and sort out the unassigned payments so that you don’t lose track of them in your day-to-day business. For further information about assigning unassigned payments and bookings to orders, refer to <a href="/en/payment/beta-managing-payments#30">Assigning payments</a>.</p>

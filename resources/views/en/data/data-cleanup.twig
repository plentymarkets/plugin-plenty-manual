    <h1>Carrying out data cleanup</h1><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This page of the manual describes how to delete certain data records after a certain time period has expired. You determine this time period in the <strong>Setup » Settings » Data » Cleanup</strong> menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 2 main reasons for deleting data using the data cleanup function:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to GDPR regulations, you as a seller are obliged to delete personal data saved in your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, you can use the data cleanup function to reduce memory usage. For example, this can help if the free memory capacity included in your plentymarkets tariff is exceeded.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="100">1. Assigning user rights</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users of the type <strong>Back end</strong> can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of the type <strong>Back end</strong> should be able to work with the data cleanup menu, a user of the type <strong>Admin</strong> has to assign at least the rights listed in the following to users with <strong>Back end</strong> access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">
<p>Assigning user rights for back end users:</p>

<div class="olist arabic">

<li>
<p>Use the search function (<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-search" style="color:blue"></i></span>) and open the user account that should be edited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activate in the <strong>Authorisations</strong> section, the options <strong>Data &gt; Data cleanup &gt; Show data cleanup</strong> and <strong>Data &gt; Data cleanup &gt; Edit data cleanup</strong>.</p>

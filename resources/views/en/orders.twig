    <h1>Orders</h1><div class="paragraph">
<p>This area contains all information about incoming orders and how to proceed after receiving orders. Depending on the sales strategy and markets you choose, orders from different <strong><a href="/en/orders/order-referrer">referrers</a></strong> are transferred to your plentymarkets system. Apart from your own online store, order referrers are primarily the different <strong><a href="/en/omni-channel/multi-channel">markets</a></strong>.<br></p>

<p>Among others, plentymarkets offers you an extensive interface to <strong><a href="/en/omni-channel/multi-channel/amazon/amazon-setup">Amazon</a></strong>.

Additional steps taking place after incoming orders, such as sending the order confirmation, sending emails or generating invoices and delivery notes, can be automatised. In addition to main orders representing orders placed by customers, several other <strong>order types</strong> exist in plentymarkets. Order types represent different business transactions.<br></p>

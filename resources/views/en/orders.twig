    <h1>Orders</h1><div class="paragraph">
<p>This area contains all information about incoming orders and how to proceed after receiving orders. Depending on the sales strategy and markets you choose, orders from different <a href="/en/orders/order-referrer">referrers</a> are transferred to your plentymarkets system. Apart from your own online shop, order referrers are primarily the different <a href="/en/markets">markets and price search engines</a>.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Among others, plentymarkets offers you an extensive interface to <a href="/en/markets/amazon/amazon-setup">Amazon</a>. This interface does not only include automatic synchronisation with Seller Central, but also further services offered by Amazon such as for example <a href="/en/markets/amazon/amazon-fulfilment">Fulfilment by Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the comprehensive <a href="/en/markets/ebay/ebay-setup">eBay</a> interface integrated in plentymarkets, you can start listings and display eBay shop items on eBay, retrieve orders, automatically post feedback and start dunning procedures for customers ordering via eBay.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Incoming orders are collected in one menu and displayed in a consistent format so that you can easily <a href="/en/orders/managing-orders#1500">manage these orders</a>. Each order receives an individual <strong>order ID</strong>. Additional steps taking place after incoming orders, such as sending the order confirmation, sending emails or generating <a href="/en/orders/order-documents">order documents</a>, can be automated. In addition to main orders representing orders placed by customers, several other <strong>order types</strong> exist in plentymarkets. Order types represent different business transactions.</p>

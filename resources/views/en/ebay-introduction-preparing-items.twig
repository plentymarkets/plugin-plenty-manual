<div class="paragraph">
<p>Want your items to reach a wider audience? Then it’s time to start thinking about eBay! With plentymarkets, you can list your items on eBay and manage the entire process from one central location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sit back and join me on a quick tour through the basic settings that you’ll need to configure when you begin listing products on eBay. The settings are easy as 1-2-3!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is link your eBay account with plentymarkets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So just navigate to the menu System » Markets » eBay » Accounts and click on the plus icon to link your eBay account with plentymarkets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the new window, enter your eBay user name and select your country platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then click on the gear wheel icon when you’re finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll be forwarded to eBay, where you’ll need to enter your login details and go through the authentication process. Congratulations, your account is active.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, let’s take a quick look at eBay business policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where you can decide on the terms of payment, shipping conditions and return policy that should apply to your eBay customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up top, just select your eBay account and eBay platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can create business policies in your plentymarkets system and then combine these individual policies into a single shipping profile, which your eBay customers will be able to see along with every item that you list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let’s move on to the second step, where we’ll focus on items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just navigate to the menu System » Item » Sales prices and open whichever price you want to use for eBay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, link the referrer eBay and second, link your actual eBay account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alright, now open the item overview, click on whichever item you want to list on eBay and then click on the "Availability" tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you’ll need to specify which markets this item should be available on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, don’t forget to save your settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now for step number three.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s create a listing for this item. This is done by clicking on the little plus icon up here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, decide whether you want to create a regular auction or whether you want the item to be sold at a fixed price.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, decide how you want to manage stock levels for your auction. If you want to manage your stock later, simply select 'unlimited (without synchronization)'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or you can limit the number of items you sell on eBay to the number of items that you actually have in stock. This will prevent you from overselling items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, decide whether you want eBay to use whatever price was saved for this item in your plentymarkets system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, select the market "eBay" and specify which platform the listing should appear on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new listing will be created when you click on Save and it can be customised down to the last detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here on the left, you can decide how long your listing should run and you can decide the maximum amount of item copies that should be sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the right, you can specify which VAT rate should apply to the listing and you can link the shipping profile that you defined in your eBay business policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you’re ready to switch to the "Market" tab and save a few settings that only apply to eBay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start out by clicking on the magnifying glass and linking your item to whichever eBay category it should appear in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, specify your item’s condition and save your changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, use this function up here to check your listing for any possible errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve passed the test, specify that the listing is ready for use and start it by clicking on the play icon up here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like I said, it’s easy as 1-2-3. Your item is now available on eBay and sales can start rolling in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

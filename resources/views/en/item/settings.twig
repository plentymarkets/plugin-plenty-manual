    <h1>Preparatory settings</h1><div class="paragraph">
<p>Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices, manufacturers, descriptive texts and images. But sometimes a little preliminary work is necessary.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can sort an item into a specific category, the category first needs to exist in plentymarkets. Before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentymarkets.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Such preparatory system settings are first configured in the <strong>Setup</strong> menu and then they’re linked to items or variations.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the most important system settings are:</p>
</div><div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/categories">Categories</a>, which group your products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/units">Units</a>, which define the content of your variations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/attributes">Attributes</a>, which simultaneously characterise your products and build variations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/properties">Characteristics and properties</a>, which characterise your products <em>without</em> building variations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000">Shipping profiles</a>, which define your shipping services and shipping costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/manufacturers">Manufacturers</a>, which list the names, contact information, IDs and commissions saved for your manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/en/item/settings/prices">Sales prices</a>, which define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price.</p>

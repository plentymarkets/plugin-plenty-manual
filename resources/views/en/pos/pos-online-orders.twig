    <h1>Processing online orders with plentyPOS</h1><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online orders (also known as <strong>Click &amp; Collect</strong>) can come into your system via your online store, markets or other referrers. There are two different scenarios for these orders in plentyPOS. Customers order items online and pay for them either online or in your store. The items are then picked up in your store. Carry out the following steps to prepare your plentyPOS for processing Click &amp; Collect orders.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="sect1">
<h2 id="100">1. Preparing pickup and payment of Click &amp; Collect orders</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following preparations are necessary for plentyPOS if you want to allow your customers to finalise online orders in your store.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The order ID is needed to search for orders at the POS.<br>
Ensure that your order confirmations contain the order ID. Inform your customers that they need this order ID to pick up their order at your store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train POS users to verify the identity of customers who come to pick up orders that were paid for online. Otherwise your POS users may hand over paid items to the wrong person by mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you use processes and/or event procedures to automatically process orders generated in the online store and/or on markets? Check your event procedures and processes before you offer store pickups. → Make sure that orders are only set to the status <strong>Outgoing items booked</strong> by an event procedure or a process after the customer has picked up the ordered items from the retail outlet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Check outgoing items in the order</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>plentyPOS displays the information that a customer has received the ordered items after the items have been booked out in plentymarkets. If problems occur and a customer insists that they have not received the items, check the order in the plentymarkets back end. The items may have been booked out too early.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also note the following information and limitations regarding payment and pickup of online orders at the retail outlet:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Online orders cannot be edited or cancelled at the POS. POS users can only book payments or save order notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online orders can only be paid for at the POS using coupons from app version 1.9.2 and higher using multipurpose coupons. However, coupons can only be used if no payment has been made for the order and no invoice document has been created yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments that are booked at the POS to clear online orders do not increase the POS’s revenue. Payments that are not revenue relevant for the POS are saved as POS events of the type <strong>Payment</strong> in the cash journal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Down payments or partial payments are not possible for online orders at the POS. Thus, customers always have to make full payments for those orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The option <strong>External order: Book outgoing items automatically</strong> of the POS settings allows you to specify if the order items are booked out of the warehouse automatically after the items have been paid for. For POS that have been created after March 5,2019, this option is activated by default. If you deactivate this option, explain to your POS users in what cases they need to manually book outgoing items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="200">2. Completing online orders at the POS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="/en/pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#450">Click &amp; Collect</a> means the process of ordering items online and picking them up at the store. In plentymarkets, such an order is loaded into plentyPOS and completed at the POS. The following scenarios are possible at the POS:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The order was placed and paid for online. The goods are picked up in the retail outlet.</p>

<p>The following chapters show you which preparations you have to make to manage online orders at the POS.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="300">2.1. Shipping settings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you already have a POS, you have already created a shipping service provider <strong>Self pickup</strong> and a shipping profile <strong>Self pickup</strong>. However, we recommend that you create a separate shipping service provider and shipping profile for Click &amp; Collect.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="400">2.1.1. Creating a shipping service provider for store pickup</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proceed as described below to create a <a href="/en/fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000">shipping service provider</a> for store pickup. In this example, we call this shipping service provider <strong>Store pickup</strong>. Of course, you can also use a different name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">
<p>Creating a shipping service provider for store pickup:</p>

<strong><em>Tip:</em></strong> Only deactivate the option if you have a separate pickup station for items, i.e. if you do not hand over items at the POS directly after payment. Educate POS users on when they should tap the button.</p>

<li>
<p>If items are to be booked out of the sales warehouse of the POS, activate the option <strong>Outgoing items for external orders: Book items out of POS sales warehouse</strong>.<br>

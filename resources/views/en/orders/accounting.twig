<p>Learn more about settings in plentymarkets that are relevant for your accounting. These settings include VAT rates, currencies, exchange rates, the calculation of your prices, booking keys, revenue accounts, debtor accounts and just as well your document templates. Most of the settings that are relevant for accounting purposes can be defined per accounting location. Only the setting that defines how your prices are calculated applies to your entire system.<br>
How to set up document templates is described on a different page of this manual.</p>

<h2 id="100">1. Basic information about price calculation in plentymarkets</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The calculation of prices is based on the gross prices of your variations. In other words, the net price of a variation in an order is calculated based on the gross price. To get the sum of an order item the individual price of one variation is multiplied with purchased number of the variation. This means, that the purchased number of a variation is multiplied with the individual gross price of an order item to get the order item’s gross sum. To get the net sum of an order item the previously calculated net price of a single variation is multiplied by the number of variations purchased. The number of decimal places of the single net price is defined by your accounting settings. To get the VAT amount for an order item the net sum must be substracted from the gross sum.<br>
Your settings define when the price will be rounded to decimal places. Calculations that are carried out after the prices are rounded will be carried out with 2 decimal places. The settings in plentymarkets can lead to the following results:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<h2 id="300">3. Carrying out VAT settings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The VAT settings are specifically for one location. You can have different settings for each location. Locations are required for your registered business addresses or countries that you ship from. There are two locations per default in your system. These locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need your own locations for the productive mode of your system.<br>
Your system behaves a little differently for countries that are members of the European Union and non-EU countries. For a location in an non-EU country every delivery to another country will be treated as export shipping. For shippings from EU member state locations the system differs between intra-community shipping and export shipping.<br>
The basic VAT relevant settings include settings that define how the system reacts for export shipping and how the VAT amount for shipping costs will be displayed. For EU locations you can also define how the system reacts if a VAT ID is given in the order. 
If you are about to or already have passed a delivery threshold you need to open your existing location and set up a <a href="/en/orders/accounting#550">new VAT configuration</a> for that country within the location. Do not create a new location if for countries where you pass the delivery threshold.</p>

In many cases the information of the delivery’s recipient are of higher priority than the ones of the invoice’s recipient.

For deliveries within the same member state of the EU the setting will be ignored and VAT will always be applied. However, there is one option that will allow a different result. You need to add an entry certificate to your delivery and you need to choose the entry certificate option for the delivery address within the data set of an order.

However, if the customer’s delivery address is in the same country as the accounting location, then VAT will be calculated for the order regardless of the setting that you have chosen. German law permits orders to be issued as net for customers from other European countries who have a valid VAT number and provide a German delivery address, but a certain paper must be provided in this case. This paper is an entry certificate and needs to be included with the order. For this reason the delivery address in an order as well as in the customer data includes the option <strong>Entry certificate</strong>. If you want to apply the entry certificate only once for a specific order, then activate the option in the order settings. If you want to use the entry certificate repetitively for this delivery address of the customer, then you need to activate the option in the customer’s delivery address data. If you activate the <strong>Entry certificate</strong> option, then orders that are placed by customers in other European countries but shipped to a German delivery address will be treated like shipments to foreign EU countries.

<p>You need to differ between your accounting locations and countries of deliveries that you need to pay tax to. An accounting location is a registered business address. 2 accounting locations exist per default in plentymarkets. The default locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need one location at the very least and you can add further locations for each of your subsidiaries. The 2 default locations include default VAT configurations with VAT rates etc. However, do not use these configurations for the productive mode of your system. Add your own configurations and delete the default ones. You need to set up at least one configuration. You can use this configuration to ship worldwide. However, you need to add further configurations for other countries if you exceed the delivery theshold for a country. Otherwise the system can not calculate the correct VAT amounts. You need to set up a location for your registered business address and then you need to set up the country that the business is in with a VAT configuration. Once you become liable for taxation in other countries because you exceeded the delivery threshold, you need to add futher countries with VAT configurations within the same location.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The buyer’s VAT rate must be used for digital items. An EU regulation puts these VAT rates into effect starting January 1st, 2015. If a VAT rate is already available for a country of delivery, e.g. because the delivery threshold was exceeded, then it is not necessary to create an additional VAT rate for digital items only. The existing VAT rate will be used. If no VAT rate is set up for one or more countries of delivery, then set up your accounting procedures in plentymarkets as described below. The EU regulation applies to B2C revenues.<br>
This regulation applies to B2C revenues. B2B revenues without VAT are not affected.</p>

<p>Learn more about settings in plentymarkets that are relevant for your accounting. These settings include VAT rates, currencies, exchange rates, the calculation of your prices, booking keys, revenue accounts, debtor accounts and just as well your document templates. Most of the settings that are relevant for accounting purposes can be defined per accounting location. Only the setting that defines how your prices are calculated as well as <a href="/en/orders/accounting#620">the taric codes</a> apply to your entire system.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="sect1">
<h2 id="100">1. Basic information about price calculation in plentymarkets</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The calculation of prices is based on the gross prices of your variations. In other words, the net price of a variation in an order is calculated based on the gross price. To get the sum of an order item the individual price of one variation is multiplied with purchased number of the variation. This means, that the purchased number of a variation is multiplied with the individual gross price of an order item to get the order item’s gross sum. To get the net sum of an order item the previously calculated net price of a single variation is multiplied by the number of variations purchased. The number of decimal places of the single net price is defined by your accounting settings. To get the VAT amount for an order item the net sum must be subtracted from the gross sum.<br>
Your settings define when the price is rounded to decimal places. Calculations that are carried out after the prices are rounded are carried out with 2 decimal places. The settings in plentymarkets can lead to the following results:</p>

<div class="ulist">

<p>You carry out settings for saving and rounding prices in the <strong>Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting</strong> menu. These settings are dependent on the client and the location. For the calculation of prices in orders, the settings configured at the time of order creation are applied.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The VAT settings are specifically for one location. You can have different settings for each location. Locations are required for your registered business addresses or countries that you ship from. There are two locations per default in your system. These locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need your own locations for the productive mode of your system.<br>
Your system behaves a little differently for countries that are members of the European Union and non-EU countries. For a location in an non-EU country every delivery to another country is treated as export shipping. For shippings from EU member state locations the system differs between intra-community shipping and export shipping.<br>
The basic VAT relevant settings include settings that define how the system reacts for export shipping and how the VAT amount for shipping costs are displayed. For EU locations you can also define how the system reacts if a VAT ID is given in the order.<br>
If you are about to or already have passed a delivery threshold you need to open your existing location and set up a <a href="/en/orders/accounting#550">new VAT configuration</a> for that country within the location. Do not create a new location if for countries where you pass the delivery threshold.</p>

In many cases the information of the delivery’s recipient are of higher priority than the ones of the invoice’s recipient.

For deliveries within the same member state of the EU the setting are ignored and VAT is always applied. However, there is one option that allows a different result. You need to add an entry certificate to your delivery and you need to choose the entry certificate option for the delivery address within the data set of an order.

<strong>Gross invoice</strong> = All invoices for inner European Union deliveries are issued as gross.<br>
<strong>Net invoice</strong> = Invoices are issued without VAT for customers who have a VAT number.<br>
However, if the customer’s delivery address is in the same country as the accounting location, then VAT is calculated for the order regardless of the setting that you have chosen. German law permits orders to be issued as net for customers from other European countries who have a valid VAT number and provide a German delivery address, but a certain paper must be provided in this case. This paper is an entry certificate and needs to be included with the order. For this reason the delivery address in an order as well as in the customer data includes the option <strong>Entry certificate</strong>. If you want to apply the entry certificate only once for a specific order, then activate the option in the order settings. If you want to use the entry certificate repetitively for this delivery address of the customer, then you need to activate the option in the customer’s delivery address data. If you activate the <strong>Entry certificate</strong> option, then orders that are placed by customers in other European countries but shipped to a German delivery address is treated like shipments to foreign EU countries. The settings <strong>VAT number</strong> and <strong>Export shipping</strong> in this menu then determine whether the invoice is issued as gross or net. If the <strong>Entry certificate</strong> is not active, then these orders are calculated as gross.</p></td>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to differ between your accounting locations and countries of deliveries that you need to pay tax to. An accounting location is a registered business address. 2 accounting locations exist per default in plentymarkets. The default locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need one location at the very least and you can add further locations for each of your subsidiaries. The 2 default locations include default VAT configurations with VAT rates etc. However, do not use these configurations for the productive mode of your system. Add your own configurations and delete the default ones. You need to set up at least one configuration. You can use this configuration to ship worldwide. However, you need to add further configurations for other countries if you exceed the delivery threshold for a country. Otherwise the system cannot calculate the correct VAT amounts. You need to set up a location for your registered business address and then you need to set up the country that the business is in with a VAT configuration. Once you become liable for taxation in other countries because you exceeded the delivery threshold, you need to add further countries with VAT configurations within the same location.</p>

<h2 id="620">4. Taric codes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taric codes, also called taric numbers, are used in EU-wide trading. These are unique and fixed numbers which are assigned to a specific commodity and have to be included in tax relevant documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taric codes are relevant for you if you have VAT registrations in delivery countries because you are trading EU-wide or if you have exceeded a <a href="/en/orders/accounting#300">delivery threshold</a> in a delivery country. In these cases, or if you know that you will exceed a delivery threshold in the foreseeable future, you should add all taric related data in time. We recommend to clarify all details regarding the taxation of your goods in other EU countries with your tax consultant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Goods are charged with different taxes in different EU countries. In order to take this into account and thus also have a correct basis for the calculation of orders, the taric codes have to be entered into the system and also checked against the VAT rates which are set for different countries.
Thus, as a first step, you have to maintain the taric codes in your system. Taric codes are entered in the <a href="/en/item/managing-items#280">variations</a>. Moreover, you need to set <a href="/en/orders/accounting#550">VAT rates</a> for the required countries. These VAT rates could also be entered later, but we recommend setting these in the system in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The table in the menu <strong>Setup » Client » Setting » Taric codes</strong> then enables the linking of taric code, VAT rate and country. Thus, this taric code table is a basis for the calculation of orders and has to be up to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock collapseBox">
<div class="title"><strong>This happens in the background when orders are calculated</strong></div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an order with France as the country of delivery enters the system. VAT rate A is set for the variation of the order item in the order. But in France, this item is taxed with the VAT rate B. That is why there is an entry in the taric code table with the same taric code as the one entered in the variation. The difference is that in the table, this taric code is linked with France and the VAT rate B. The order logic recognises these cases and uses the VAT rate set in the taric code table.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case there is no taric code entered in the variation or in the table, no differing VAT rate is used for the calculation. This means that you only have to enter the corresponding taric codes in the table if a variation is <em>taxed differently</em> in other countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to import taric codes you can use either the import tool or enter them manually. We recommend to the import tool and to enter only single taric codes or carry out small adaptations manually.
<em>Note</em> that only numbers up to 12 characters are allowed. Entering special or blank characters is not allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find general information about imports via the import tool on the manual page <a href="/en/data/importing-data/ElasticSync">Using the import tool</a>. The import type for importing taric codes is <a href="/en/data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-assignment-taric-code">Assignment taric codes</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fill the table manually, proceed as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">
<p>Filling the taric code table manually:</p>

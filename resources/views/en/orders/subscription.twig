    <h1>Subscription</h1><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the subscription module to generate orders that are automatically sent to your customers at preferred intervals you chose. By using the subscription, you do not have to create each order separately because the selected items are automatically and regularly sent to your customers.
Thus, you can create individual subscriptions for customers and configure the settings as required.<br>
You can conveniently create and edit subscriptions in an own section in the back end of your plentymarkets system.
Orders that were generated by subscriptions are editable in the order overview, just like other orders. In this chapter, we explain how you <a href="/en/orders/subscription#200">create a subscription</a>, how you <a href="/en/orders/subscription#300">set up and edit a subscription</a> and which other options and functions are available to you.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="sect1">
<h2 id="100">1. Preparatory settings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should take note of and decide on some preparatory settings. Having set those, you can work with subscriptions more conveniently. On the one hand, you can select <a href="/en/orders/subscription#110">default settings</a> for subscriptions, so that these settings are preselected when you are creating a new subscription and do not have to be carried out every time. Deciding on those settings beforehand saves time when you create new subscriptions. On the other hand, you have to assign <a href="/en/orders/subscription#120">user rights</a> if users of the type back end are to work with subscriptions as well. The default settings as well as the settings for assigning the required user rights are described in the following two chapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, tables are customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">
<p>Customise table:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Confirm</strong> to save your settings.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="110">1.1. Determining default settings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go to the menu  <strong>Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription</strong> to decide on default settings for your subscriptions.
Thus, the settings chosen here are preselected for your new subscriptions and can accelerate your workflow if you regularly need the same settings for subscriptions.
However, it is still possible to decide on different settings when creating a new subscription.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Subscription run preview</strong> is also available in the <strong>Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription</strong> menu.
Click on the button <strong>Subscription run preview</strong> and a new window with an overview of all <strong>Due subscriptions</strong> opens. These are sorted in ascending order by order IDs.
Additionally, the duration of the subscriptions as well as the last and the next run are displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The information which subscriptions are due is retrieved once a day by the system. The <strong>Subscription run preview</strong> does not only offer you an overview and the option to review due subscriptions, you can also trigger due subscriptions immediately.
 When doing this, take into account that <em>all due subscriptions are triggered at once</em>. A selection of individual subscriptions is not possible in this overview.
How you can trigger manual runs for individual subscriptions in the detail view of each subscription is explained further below in the chapter  <a href="/en/orders/subscription#800">Fulfilled orders: Runs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, when due subscriptions are displayed, click on <strong>Subscription run preview</strong> in the lower right hand corner of the overview to trigger an immediate manual run. Wait a moment after clicking on the button.
The message <strong>Run executed</strong> is displayed after completion. You can see the orders generated by this in the <strong>Order overview</strong> as well as in the section <a href="/en/orders/subscription#800">Fulfilled orders</a> of the detail overview of the corresponding subscription.</p>

<p>You can edit the order item properties in the shopping cart. Any changes made here only apply to the subscription in which they are edited. The properties themselves stay as they are configured in the system. Only the properties already created and configured in the system are available in the subscription.<br>
If you want to create and edit properties or are not yet familiar with the structure of properties, refer to the manual chapter <a href="/en/item/settings/properties#500">Properties</a> first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to link a property with an order item, the property has to be marked as <strong>Order property</strong> in the <strong>Options</strong> area of the property settings. Also set possible surcharges and VAT rates for the property in the <a href="/en/item/settings/properties#property-options">options area</a>. The values added here will be included on the calculations.</p>

To edit the properties or to add more already existing properties, click on <strong>Edit properties</strong> (<span class="icon "><i class="fa fa-pencil  "></i></span>).

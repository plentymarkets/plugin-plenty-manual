<p>Omni-channel sale with plentymarkets means for you that you can use many different channels to offer your items to customers and, therefore, generate orders from many different sources.
Some referrers are set up by default and are fixed entries that can not be changed.
Other referrers are automatically added e.g. when you integrate a plugin or plentyPOS.
Referrers from plugin can not be deleted either. At last you can also manually set up referrers.
Manually set up referrers are useful to register e.g. orders made via telephone or you can set up referrers for price search engines or affiliate service providers.
Each referrer has a unique ID. Some referrers have sub-referrers. The ID for a sub-referrer is composed of the ID of the main referrer followed by two decimal numbers. <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>eBay</strong> and plentyPOS are examples for main referrers that have sub-referrers.
Each country platform of eBay and Amazon has a sub-referrer just like every till registered with plentyPOS will have a sub-referrer.
All orders, no matter where they were made originally, are collected and displayed in the order menu.
The referrer can be found in the <strong>Settings</strong> tab of an order.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The order search in the <strong>Order » Edit orders</strong> menu offers many filters to narrow down the number of results. The <strong>Referrer</strong> filter searches for orders that have a specific referrer (Client (store), Amazon, eBay etc.). Amazon and eBay have both general referrers and sub-referrers for each of the country platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For monthly overviews, it makes sense to use a date as an additional filter, e.g. the date when orders were received. The <strong>Statistics</strong> menu provides you with other possibilities for the analysis.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>referrer</strong> can also be found in the <strong>Settings</strong> tab of a single order. The referrer can only be changed if it is a manually created referrer and only as long as no invoice was created yet.</p>

<p>The referrer is important for measuring how well your items sell on different platforms. This information tells you which platforms are most profitable. In the orders menu, you can use the referrer and date filters to see the total revenue that was generated by each order referrer during a specific time period. In the <strong>Statistics</strong>
menu, you can also select an order referrer and see the revenue that was generated by each referrer. Based on these figures you can better decide where and how to invest in the future.</p>

<h2 id="100">1. What does the error message “Request is throttled” mean?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number of requests for each process, such as order import, stock synchronisation, shipping confirmations etc., is limited by Amazon (Maximum Request Quota). If the maximum number of requests is exceeded, the process is blocked and further requests are rejected by Amazon. After a while, new capacities are unlocked a bit at a time (The Leaky Bucket Algorithm), and data transfer is enabled once again.</p>

<h2 id="200">2. Major cause of the error</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use a European marketplace account at Amazon, this error often occurs because a configuration in plentymarkets results in too many requests being sent to this Amazon account at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Background</strong>: In the <strong>Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings</strong> menu, several Amazon accounts were linked to different platforms. However, those platforms all "access" the same European marketplace account. The accounts always have the same merchant ID. Various processes were activated in one/some of these accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amazon platforms which are mostly summarised in one European marketplace account (as of 15 May 2017):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, Amazon.es, Amazon.co.uk</p>

<h2 id="300">3. How to solve the error:</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use a European Amazon marketplace account, it is useful to activate the processes only for one marketplace account in the <strong>Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings</strong> menu. Otherwise, the data traffic of those processes will be transferred for every single Amazon account with the same merchant ID.</p>

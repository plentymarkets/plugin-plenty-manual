<p>This best practice informs you about Amazon’s VAT calculation service VCS and explains what to consider when setting VCS up in plentymarkets.</p>

<p>An overview of VCS and an instruction how to activate it in plentymarkets can be found on the <a href="/en/markets/amazon/amazon-setup#3150">Amazon page of the manual</a>.</p>

<p>You can use two different VCS options in plentymarkets:</p>

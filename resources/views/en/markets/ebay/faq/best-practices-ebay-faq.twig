<h2 id="700">7. What do the error messages mean?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many errors which occur when setting up listings are issued by eBay and then displayed in your plentymarkets system.
For an overview of error messages, refer to the following list of <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/devzone/xml/docs/reference/ebay/errors/errormessages.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay error messages</a>&nbsp;<span class="icon "><i class="fa fa-external-link  "></i></span>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="710">7.1. Variation specifics cannot be changed. Variation specifics cannot be changed in restricted revise.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refer to the chapter <strong>Which data can be changed at active listings and when?</strong><br>
If this error message occurs, the variations in plentymarkets do not match the variations on eBay any longer.<br>
Therefore, the variations, including attribute name and values, have to be changed so that they correspond with the listing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Compare the eBay attributes and attribute names to the attributes and attribute names in plentymarkets. Also bear in mind the attribute link in the <strong>Setup » Item » Attributes</strong> menu if you use an attribute link for this category.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="720">7.2. Variation Specifics Mismatch. Variation Specifics provided does not match with the variation specifics of the variations on the item.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This error message is either issued during the automatic relisting process or if you select the option <strong>End and restart</strong>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these cases it is possible to keep the old listing’s ranking and to transfer the ranking to the new listing.<br>
eBay expects that the variations which have already been sold are <strong>not changed</strong>.<br>
If this happens, the aforementioned error message will be issued and restarting the listing will fail.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br>
A.
Restore the variations to their state in the old listing.
This means that if you removed variations, you have to add them again. If you changed the variations' names, you have to undo the change or create an attribute link for the corresponding attribute within <strong>Setup » Item » Attributes</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>B.
End the listing with the <strong>End and delete</strong> option and restart it with the group function.
However, the ranking of your listing will be lost during this process.</p>

<h2 id="800">8. How does eBay Picture Services work and how is it used?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With eBay Picture Services, listing images are uploaded to eBay and retrieved by the eBay servers. Without eBay Picture Services, the image is retrieved by the plentymarkets servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If and how you should use eBay Picture Services is described below:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="810">8.1. Listing a single item</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>One image</strong>:<br>
The setting within <strong>Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Initial settings</strong> is applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Activated</strong>: The image is uploaded to eBay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deactivated</strong>: The listing’s image is provided by our servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>More than one image</strong>:<br>
eBay Picture Services is used automatically. In this case, the initial settings are ignored.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="820">8.2. Listing a variation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>One image</strong>:<br>
The setting within <strong>Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Initial settings</strong> is applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Activated</strong>: The image is uploaded to eBay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Deactivated</strong>: The listing’s image is provided by our servers. In this case, you can link every variation to a different image.<br>
For example, if you have 10 variations, you can upload 11 different images without using eBay Picture Services: 1 gallery image and 10 variation images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>More than one image</strong>:<br>
eBay Picture Services is used automatically. In this case, the initial settings are ignored.</p>

<h2 id="900">9. Why is the telephone number not transferred when orders are imported?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of the telephone number, eBay transfers “Invalid Request” to plentymarkets by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Log into eBay. Go to <strong>Account Settings » Site Preferences » Shipping preferences</strong> and activate the option <strong>Require phone number for shipping</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>

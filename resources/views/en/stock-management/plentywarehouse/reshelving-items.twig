<p>At the moment, plentyWarehouse is available as part of an open beta phase. This means that the app is adjusted regularly due to improvements and bug fixes.

<p>The plentyWarehouse app includes a function for reshelving items. You can find information about it on this page. First, you’ll read a short description of the function to help you understand the concept. Then you’ll learn about the <a href="/en/app/functions/warehouse-management/reshelving#200">settings</a>, which need to be carried out once in advance. These settings go into effect when you begin using the function.</p>

<div class="title">Workflow for reshelving items</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of the items start out in the same spot. For example, maybe cashiers put returned items in a box behind the sales counter. Or maybe, incoming items are always stored at a specific area of your warehouse and are transferred to permanent storage location later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the warehouse staff is ready to put the items into the racks, the plentyWarehouse app is opened. First, the storage location from which the items are taken is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Afterwards, the app lists all of the items that are currently at the selected storage location. Employees select the first item. Then, the storage location to which the item should be reshelved is selected in the app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plentyWarehouse app automatically switches back to the list of items waiting to be reshelved. The warehouse staff repeat this process until all items have been reshelved or the reshelving function is exited manually.</p>

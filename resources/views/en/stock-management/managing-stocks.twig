Stock that is reserved for listings is separated from the quantity that is reserved for orders. The quantity listed on a market will be part of the net stock if you do not reserve stock for listings. The net stock is the quantity available for sale anywhere. Go to <strong>Setup » Listings</strong> and open the submenu <strong>stock</strong> to set the stock options for listings. When you create a market listing, select <strong>limited (with reservation)</strong> for the stock dependence. This will reserve the listed quantity.

<h2 id="200">2. Reserving stock</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system can reserve stock for listings and orders if you manage your stock in plentymarkets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph subhead">
<p>When is stock reserved?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have already described the reserved stock as the quantity of variations that have been ordered or as the difference between the physical stock and the net stock. Now we want to take a closer look at the cases in which plentymarkets can automatically reserve stock.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When orders are created:<br>
If an item is purchased, an order will be created and the variation will automatically be reserved until the order is either cancelled or until it is booked out. The reservations will be applied to all orders from all kinds of referrers, also from external markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When warranties are created:<br>
If an item is returned by a customer, you can create a <a href="/en/orders/managing-orders#600">warranty</a> for one or more items by opening the original order. These warranties are treated as individual orders with a distinct order number. Stock is reserved until either variations are booked out or until the warranty itself is cancelled again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When listings are posted:<br>
If you do not reserve stock for active listings, it is possible that you may end up empty-handed after a listing has been terminated. This is because you may already have sold the item. In order to stay away from this kind of trouble and bad evaluations, it is recommended that you use the system’s function of reserving stock for active listings. Go to <strong>Setup » Listings</strong> and open the sub-menu <strong>stock</strong> to select the relevant options for stock and listings. When you create a market listing, select <strong>limited (with reservation)</strong> for the <strong>stock dependence</strong>. This will reserve the listed quantity. As soon as a listing was successfully completed, the setting is no longer active. However, the sold item is now part of an order and is reserved within the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exception item bundles:<br>
<strong>Item bundles</strong> consist of multiple products. No individual stock is administered for those bundles in plentymarkets. The stock of item bundles directly depends on the stock of the single items contained in the bundle. If a bundle is sold, the items included in it are automatically taken over into the reserved stock.<br>
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> A bundle is only available, if its components are stored in the same warehouse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="sect1">
<h2 id="300">3. Searching stocks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When opening the menu <strong>Stock » Stocks</strong> no filters are set and a search for all stocks will be carried out automatically. By default, the results are sorted by variation ID. In addition, the stocks of a variation are sorted by warehouse. Use filters to narrow down the stock results.<br>
The column titles are abbreviated. If you point your cursor over an abbreviation, you will see the entire name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The displayed parameters depend on the user’s rights. Options that can be restricted for a user are e.g. the warehouse options. Go to <strong>Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User » [select user]</strong> and check the settings for users who work with stocks.</p>

<h2 id="800">9. Checking reserved stock</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Booking out variations is crucial for managing stocks correctly. If you note that reserved stock exists for a variation or that more stock is reserved than should be and you know for sure that all orders have been shipped, you can search for orders that have not been booked out. Stock remains reserved until you booked out the variations. This means that the order status does not influence whether or not stock is reserved. The important step is to actually book the variations out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our recommended course of action that many users follow is to first book out the variations and to use this action to set the order to status 7. Use status 7 to display all orders that are in status 7 but that have not been booked out correctly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The automatic stock update works in such a way that certain orders are automatically moved to another status.<br>
<strong>Example</strong>: For orders in status 4 it is checked whether there is stock available. If that is the case and the user has activated the option in the order settings, they are automatically moved to status 5. In the <strong>Stock » Stocks</strong> menu you can find the respective buttons <strong>Recalculate stocks</strong> and <strong>Order status 4 or 5 - calculate</strong>.
<strong>Automatic stock update (b)</strong> means that the stocks have been recalculated and <strong>automatic stock update (m)</strong> means that the order status 4 or 5 has been calculated.
If you want to avoid that an order with stock is automatically moved to status 5, you should not use status 4.

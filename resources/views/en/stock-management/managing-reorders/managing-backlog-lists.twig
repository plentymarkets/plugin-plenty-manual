<p>The backlog lists show you variations that have been reordered but have not been booked in yet. In other words, variations that are undelivered. Furthermore, you will learn where you can see variations that are returned and should be on the way back to you.</p>

<p>Variations that have been <a href="/en/stock-management/managing-reorders/working-with-reorders">reordered</a>, but have not been booked in yet, are listed in the <strong>Stock » Reorder management » Backlog list</strong> menu. A search will not automatically be carried out when you open the menu. The default search is not limited by any filters. This means the default search will search for all undelivered variations from all warehouses and suppliers and regardless of how old the reorder is. Use filters to limit the search results.</p>

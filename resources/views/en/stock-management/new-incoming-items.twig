<p>Use the search function in the incoming items menu to find specific data records. Many of the search filters refer to items or variations. Thus, you can use the filters to search for incoming items data records that include items or variations with this ID, number or flag. When you open the menu, the last 2 months are automatically selected as delivery period. If you want to find an incoming items data record that is older, you need to reset the filters first.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <strong>Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items</strong> menu, it is possible to determine a period of time after which empty storage locations are deleted. When activating the option <strong>Delete empty storage location after</strong>, the entry is removed from the table after expiration of the determined period and the linkage to the individual items is deleted. In the system, it is no longer considered that the item has ever existed on the storage location.<br>
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> This does not apply to the standard storage location (ID 0) of the main warehouse on the item or on the variation; this one is always visible.</p>

<h2 id="2000">10. Hiding stock entries of 0</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <strong>Stock » Stock » Incoming items</strong> menu, it is possible to determine a period of time after which stock entries of 0 are hidden. In case an item is stored in a second warehouse, the stock is set to zero. By activating the option <strong>Hide stock entry of “0” after</strong>, the entry in the variation’s stock overview disappears after the determined period, but remains saved in the background. Thus, reversals or incoming items that have the setting <strong>Used storage location</strong> can still use and display this storage location.<br>
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> This does not apply to the standard storage location (ID 0) of the main warehouse on the item or on the variation; this one is always visible.</p>

    <h1>Booking items out</h1><div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Booking out stock is the second event of central importance for your stock management. The stock calculated by the system only matches the actual stock in your warehouses if your stock is correctly booked in and out. <br>
The main reason to book out stock is that the variations are delivered to customers, but other stock withdrawals - that occur for any reason - need to be registered correctly as well. Furthermore, special events such as cancellations, returns and warranties require special attention as these might cause systematic stock shortfall in your warehouses. <br>
You can book out stock manually or automatically. Manually booking each order requires extremely high individual effort and bears the risk that this important step will not be carried out systematically. However, if you wish to automate the outgoing items step, you need to identify a trigger event that occurs directly before the variations should be booked out.
Do you enter the package number before you book stock out? If so, you can use the fact that package numbers were entered as a trigger to book out stock. How to book out stock manually will be explained at the end of this page. The manual booking process may be necessary in rare individual cases. One case could be that a customer picks up his or her order directly and in such a case you will not enter any package number. This is one case that may require manual booking for individual orders.</p>

<h2 id="_dependencies_when_booking_out_stock">1. Dependencies when booking out stock</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two points are particularly important when you want to understand how your system works:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Book outgoing items</strong> is a procedure that has to be carried out and it is not just an order status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an order is set to status 7 – <strong>Outgoing items booked</strong>, the order cannot be set to a status lower than 7.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph subhead">
<p>The difference between the procedure and the status for booking out stock</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When delivering orders, you have to book the outgoing items in order to correctly reduce the stock.
Booking out stock is a procedure and not just a status change. The procedure <strong>Book outgoing items</strong> causes the stock to be reduced and then changes the status of an order to status 7 – <strong>Outgoing items booked</strong>. If only the status of an order changes to status 7 – <strong>Outgoing items booked</strong>, then this does not actually cause the procedure to be carried out and this means that the stock will not be reduced. If the stock is not reduced, your entire stock management may become incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph subhead">
<p>Status range 7 is final</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an order has a status between 7.0 and 7.9 and its outgoing items have already been booked, then the order cannot be reset to a status lower than 7.0.<br>
Reverse outgoing items: However, if you reverse the booking of outgoing items, then this will enable a status change below 7. At the same time, you will be given the option to delete the order, which allows you to create a new or corrected order. If an invoice or any other document exists, you cannot delete the order. You need to cancel the document first and then you can correct your information or cancel the entire order. The original document and the cancellation document are proof of conformity with financial regulations.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is best to execute routine tasks such as booking out items automatically to ensure that the day-to-day routine of your online business runs smoothly and efficiently.
plentymarkets offers different ways to do so. Select the way that best suits your routine. Next, two ways to book out stock will be described. The first way books stock out when an invoice is generated and the second when the package number is entered.</p>

<p>The system processes orders in a specific order that is defined by different factors such as the time they were created and the time they were ready for packing etc.
These factors ensure that the customer that ordered first will be served first.
If you start to book the outgoing items for an order that has not yet reached the status for shipping, status 5, or that you have set manually to status 5 or any higher status, you are skipping the order that was defined automatically and your system cannot continue correctly.
Depending on the number of orders that were in line in front of the order that you booked manually, the automatic booking may cause errors for weeks or even months.</p>

<h3 id="_using_the_package_number_to_book_outgoing_items_automatically">2.1. Using the package number to book outgoing items automatically</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage of using the package number when booking out stock is that package numbers are usually generated with shipping labels at the end of the fulfilment process. This ensures that all orders that have a shipping label witch a package number are actually about to be shipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use an event procedure to automate the booking of outgoing items. In addition, you can use the same event procedure to send the shipping confirmation via email to your customer.
The email can also be send with a separate event procedure. After setting up the event procedure you will learn how to scan the package numbers.</p>

<p>Import your package numbers to save the package numbers automatically in the order data. This way you do not need to enter every package number manually in an order.
The fastest and easiest way to import newly created package numbers into your system on a daily basis is to go to <strong>Orders » Fulfilment » Tab: Import of package numbers</strong>.
Ideally, you created and printed a <strong>pick list</strong> for the final order processing, you marked all of the orders that are already finished in this list and you stuck small barcode slips of the shipping labels next to the corresponding order.</p>

<p>plentymarkets adds the package number to the order data. This will trigger the event procedure that books out the stock and sends the order confirmation email to your customer.
The order status will automatically change when the stock is booked out. The new status will be <strong>Outgoing items booked</strong>.
This behaviour is implemented in the system and cannot be disabled.
You can use this status to check whether or not the outgoing items have been booked after the import.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automatically booking out outgoing items will only work correctly if you are not sending any items before you have generated an invoice. However, the fact that an invoice was generated cannot guarantee that outgoing items were booked and that a package was sent. When the payment method payment in advance was selected, it may be the case that the invoice is generated before the outgoing items are booked. Another possible case is that the variation was damaged and your employee saw the defect while picking orders. In this case the invoice may have been generated but the outgoing items will not be delivered.
If you still want to use the generation of an invoice as trigger event, you should set a filter for payment methods and exclude payment in advance from the list.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the data format <strong>Stock</strong> it is possible to change the stock of all variations at once. This is for example helpful, if you want to enter all current stocks into the system after a stocktaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further application possibilities are the redistribution of stock to a new storage location in the same warehouse or into a new warehouse.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to better understand the process, we will give you three concrete examples. The first example shows the necessary steps for correcting the stock. However, the stock remains in the same warehouse as before.
In the second example, the whole stock is transferred into another warehouse. The third example shows how to delete stock and demonstrates what needs to be considered when doing so.
The data format Stock is used for all of the above mentioned examples and the following parameters must be included:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the described procedure, for a short period of time there is more stock booked in the system than there actually exists. You should especially pay attention to this when having a small stock in which the existing stock is already completely reserved and therefore there may currently be no listing active etc. Due to the additional stock, automated actions such as sending emails or starting listings could be triggered. Basically, the stock in the old warehouse can also be set to zero first, but in that case, listings or other offers that are connected with the stock automatism, may be closed.</p>

<p>Deleting stock</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When deleting stock you should ensure legally compliant working. Currently, it is possible to delete stock. As this leads to the loss of stock movements, this is not GoBD compliant (German regulation), which is why we advise against doing so. Instead, we recommend using the following procedure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph instruction">
<p>Deleting stock:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Export the stock via dynamic export.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt the CSV file by setting the stocks to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reimport them afterwards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By doing so, the stock movements aren’t lost and legally compliant working is guaranteed. Deleting a warehouse also leads to the deletion of stock movements, which can’t be recreated. Thus, this isn’t GoDB compliant either.</p>
